# Adventure Technology Study

## Introduction

This is the small text based adventure program. It is intended as a C++
training example to test the following topics:

*   cmake
*   cppcheck
*   igloo
*   boost

From this installment a template to be used for other c++ projects will be
derived.

## Installation

Simply clone this repository and copy make.local.template to make.local. It
contains two definitions which have to be adopted to your system.

        BOOST_ROOT=/c/lib/boost_1_57_0
        IGLOO_ROOT=/c/lib/igloo-igloo.1.1.1

After adopting it to your system simple execute the Makefile by running

        $ make
